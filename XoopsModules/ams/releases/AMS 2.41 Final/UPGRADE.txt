UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS:

Upgrade from AMS 2.2
1) Upload all files in this package - overwrite existing files
2) Log in to the site
3) Point your browser to modules/AMS/upgrade
4) Select "Update module" - you will be passed on to the module administration's update, but an update script will have run prior to that, so it is important not just going to modules administration and then updating (this is a one-time database update, so if you update the module later, e.g. after changing the templates, you will not need to update the module through here)

In order to import topics, articles, permissions, comments and attachments from an existing News module
1) Log in as administrator to the site
2) Go to [yoursite]/modules/AMS/upgrade
3) Follow instructions on screen
NOTE: If you decide to import comments from News, they WILL NO LONGER BE IN THE NEWS MODULE. 
Comments are moved - NOT copied

Thank you
